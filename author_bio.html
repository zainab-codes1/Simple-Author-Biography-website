    <h2>Early Life</h2> 
    <p>Childhood </p>

      <p>  Dahl at age 10 with his sisters Alfhild, Else and Asta. Cardiff, 1927.
        Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegians Harald Dahl (1863–1920) and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (née Hesselberg) (1885–1967).
        Dahl's father, a wealthy shipbroker and self-made man, had emigrated to the UK from Sarpsborg in Norway and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s with his first wife, Frenchwoman Marie Beaurin-Gresser. 
        They had two children together (Ellen Marguerite and Louis) before her death in 1907. Roald Dahl's mother belonged to a well-established Norwegian family of lawyers, priests in the state church 
        and wealthy merchants and estate owners, and emigrated to the UK when she married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, 
        which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild, and Else. The children were raised in Norway's Lutheran state church, the Church of Norway, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff.
        His maternal grandmother Ellen Wallace was a granddaughter of the member of parliament Georg Wallace and a descendant of an early 18th-century Scottish immigrant to Norway.
    </p> 
      <p> Dahl's sister Astri died from appendicitis at age seven in 1920 when Dahl was three years old, and his father died of pneumonia at age 57 several weeks later. Later that year, his youngest sister, Asta, was born. 
        Upon his death, Harald Dahl left a fortune assessed for probate of £158,917 10s. 0d. (equivalent to £6,791,035 in 2021). Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales instead of returning to Norway to live with relatives, 
        as her husband had wanted their children to be educated in English schools, which he considered the world's best. When he was six years old, Dahl met his idol Beatrix Potter, author of The Tale of Peter Rabbit featuring 
        the mischievous Peter Rabbit, the first licensed fictional character. In 2020 their meeting was dramatised in the television drama film, Roald & Beatrix: The Tail of the Curious Mouse. 
    </p>
    <p>Following his graduation from Repton, a renowned British public school, in 1934, Dahl avoided a university education and joined an expedition to Newfoundland. He worked from 1937 to 1939 in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika (now in 
        Tanzania), but he enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF) when World War II broke out. Flying as a fighter pilot, he was seriously injured in a crash landing in Libya. He served with his squadron in Greece and then in Syria 
        before doing a stint (1942–43) as assistant air attaché in Washington, D.C. (during which time he also served as a spy for the British government). There the novelist C.S. Forester encouraged him to write about his most exciting 
        RAF adventures, which were published by the Saturday Evening Post.</p>

    <h2>Notable Works</h2> 
    <p>Dahl’s first book, The Gremlins (1943), was written for Walt Disney but was largely unsuccessful. 
        His service in the RAF influenced his first story collection, Over to You: Ten Stories of Flyers and Flying (1946),
         a series of military tales that was warmly received by critics but did not sell well. He achieved best-seller 
        status with Someone like You (1953; rev. ed. 1961), a collection of macabre stories for adults, which was followed
         by Kiss, Kiss (1959), which focused on stormy romantic relationships.
        </p> 
        <p>Matilda
            Book jacket of the 2002 edition of Matilda (1988), written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake.
            Dahl then turned primarily to writing the children’s books that would give him lasting fame. Unlike most other book
            s aimed at a young audience, Dahl’s works had a darkly comic nature, frequently including gruesome violence and death. 
            His villains were often malevolent adults who imperiled precocious and noble child protagonists. James and the Giant Peach
             (1961; film 1996), written for his own children, was a popular success, as was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), 
            which was made into the films Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005). 
            His other works for young readers include Fantastic Mr. Fox (1970; film 2009), Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator (1972),
             The Enormous Crocodile (1978), The BFG (1982; films 1989 and 2016), and The Witches (1983; film 1990). One of his last 
            such books, Matilda (1988), was adapted for film (1996 and 2022) and the stage (2010).
            While Dahl focused primarily on children’s literature late in his career, he continued to produce short stories for adult 
            audiences during this time, which were published in collections such as Switch Bitch (1974), The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,
             and Six More (1977), and Tales of the Unexpected (1979). Dahl also wrote several scripts for movies, among them You Only Live 
            Twice (1967) and (with Ken Hughes and Richard Maibaum) Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968). 
            His autobiography, Boy: Tales of Childhood, was published in 1984.</p>

            <p>While his lasting reputation to many is that of a beloved children’s author, Dahl has also been a controversial figure both 
                during his lifetime and after. Some of his works, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, were criticized at the time of 
                their publication for their use of racial and sexual stereotypes, but his most notable transgressions came outside of his 
                fiction. In several interviews and nonfiction writings during the 1980s and ’90s, Dahl expressed opinions that were widely 
                viewed as anti-Semitic. While he defended himself as being “anti-Israel” rather than anti-Semitic, that distinction was not 
                accepted by a number of readers, and his estate published an apology for his statements in 2020. Three years later, Dahl’s 
                publishers announced that they had revised hundreds of insensitive and outdated passages in his classic children’s books, 
                a move that was met with both support for reflecting a changing culture and criticism for perceived editorial overreach.</p>
